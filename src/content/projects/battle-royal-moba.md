Battle Royale MOBA is a top-down action prototype built around a clear
separation between authoritative gameplay simulation and real-time presentation.
The project explores how a MOBA-style command model, hero combat, bot behavior,
pathfinding, and a responsive Godot view can work together without coupling
gameplay rules to rendering code.

## Design Direction

The project follows four central ideas:

- **Simulation is authoritative.** Movement, targeting, casting, combat,
  progression, pickups, and bot decisions are resolved by a fixed-rate
  simulation rather than by rendered frames.
- **Simulation and presentation are independent.** The simulation does not
  depend on Godot scene nodes or view behavior. The Godot layer sends commands
  and renders the latest published state.
- **Player and bots share the same gameplay pipeline.** Bots express movement,
  attack, and skill intent through the same hero input state used by the local
  player. They then pass through the same pathfinding, movement, casting, and
  combat systems.
- **Gameplay is data-oriented and extensible.** Entities are composed from
  components, systems operate on those components, hero definitions reference
  skills by ID, and individual skills implement their own behavior behind a
  common interface.

The intended interaction model is a focused MOBA command scheme: right-click
movement, Q/W/E/R skills, and A-based attack commands. The project deliberately
keeps one command model instead of maintaining separate WASD and MOBA modes.

### Simulation layer

`SimServer` is the GDExtension-facing entry point. It owns a simulation `World`,
which contains the EnTT registry, navigation data, command buffer, simulation
clock, and random number generator.

The world advances at 30 Hz. Each tick applies the current input state and runs
a defined system pipeline covering:

1. Local input injection and bot decision-making.
2. Unified attack and skill command processing.
3. A* pathfinding, movement, and wall collision.
4. Projectiles, direct combat, area effects, status effects, and resource
   regeneration.
5. Pickups, skill cooldowns, skill leveling, and progression.
6. Snapshot export for the view layer.

Entity creation and destruction are deferred through `CommandBuffer`, so systems
do not invalidate the registry while iterating over it. Systems communicate
through components rather than direct cross-system calls or global state.

### Hero and skill model

Players and bots are heroes in the same simulation model. A hero owns runtime
components such as health, resources, movement state, input state, progression,
and skill slots. A local-player marker distinguishes the controlled hero from
AI-controlled heroes; it does not create a separate combat implementation.

Hero definitions provide base data and references to four skill IDs. Skills are
independent `ISkill` implementations registered in a skill registry. The cast
system dispatches validation, targeting, cast lifecycle, and effects to the
selected skill, allowing new skills to be added without expanding a monolithic
hero or combat switch.

Bots use a layered decision model. Goal selection, combat phase selection, and
skill scoring produce intents that are injected into `HeroInputState`. The
regular hero systems then handle chasing, movement, attacks, and casts, keeping
AI behavior aligned with player behavior.

### View layer

`sim_bridge.gd` coordinates the runtime boundary. It collects input, translates
semantic commands into `SimServer` calls, advances the simulation, and publishes
snapshots to presentation systems.

The view runs at the render rate, normally 60 Hz. It interpolates or
synchronizes presentation state independently of the 30 Hz simulation, while
sequence-gating snapshot updates so entities, health bars, and one-shot events
are not processed repeatedly.

The main presentation responsibilities are split into focused components:

- `EntityManager` synchronizes hero, projectile, pickup, and other world views.
- `CameraController` handles follow, free camera, drag, edge-pan, and camera
  smoothing behavior.
- `UIRoot` owns the persistent HUD, health bars, skill slots, cast feedback, and
  settings presentation.
- `SkillVFX` dispatches per-skill visual effects from authoritative cast
  transitions.
- `WorldBootstrap` creates static lighting, environment, ground, and world
  presentation.
- `MoveTargetVFX` presents movement command feedback without changing simulation
  state.

The `CommandBuffer` preserves input edges between render frames and simulation
ticks. The `SimSnapshot` is the only simulation-to-view data channel: the view
never reaches into the ECS registry, and the simulation never calls view code.

## Core Design Decisions

### Fixed-rate authority with render-rate presentation

Gameplay uses a stable 30 Hz simulation clock. Presentation can update more
frequently and smooth visible motion without changing the authoritative result
of a tick.

### ECS systems over object hierarchies

Gameplay state is stored in components such as position, health, hero input,
skill slots, cast state, bot state, and projectile state. Small systems
transform that state in a predictable order, making player, bot, and world
interactions share the same rules.

### Deferred world mutation

Systems request entity creation or destruction through the command buffer. The
world flushes those requests at the end of the tick, preserving safe iteration
and explicit lifecycle boundaries.

### Snapshot-based isolation

Snapshots provide a narrow, inspectable contract between simulation and view.
They carry state and discrete events needed for rendering, animation, UI, and
VFX without exposing simulation internals.

### Presentation as a consumer

Godot scenes and scripts are responsible for displaying state, responding to
input, and managing visual lifecycles. They do not decide damage, movement
validity, skill results, bot outcomes, or other authoritative gameplay rules.
